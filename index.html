      <h2>Selenkay Conservancy</h2>
      <img src="http://www.magicalkenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/conservancyimg7.jpg" width="700px">
      <p>
        The Conservancy is one of the pioneers of community conservation in Kenya.
        Selenkay shares the same eco-system as Amboseli and is established on lands leased from the local Maasai by Gamewatchers Safaris Ltd with the aim of
         protecting the habitation and encouraging wildlife conservation as an alternative to farming as a means for the local population to earn a living.
         Wildlife: Visitors can expect to see elephants, Thomson and Grant’s gazelles, lions, cheetahs and leopards, bat eared fox, mongooses, porcupine, giraffe and yellow baboon among the many now indigenous species
         Getting there: Road: 175 kms from Nairobi, down the Mombasa road and via Emali (roughly 4 1/2 hours).  Air: Chartered flights are able to land at the Selenkay airstrip, located 5 minutes drive from
         Porini Amboseli Safari Camp.

         <h2>Olkinyei Conservancy</h2>
         <img src="http://ih.constantcontact.com/fs166/1101069424019/img/363.jpg">
         <p>
           The Olkinyei conservancy was founded in 2005 through a partnership between 171 local private landowners and Gamewatchers Safaris & Porini Safari Camps.Since the formation of the Conservancy many indigenous species have returned to the land.
           The Conservancy is now home to a wide variety of wildlife including a resident pride of over 30 lions, leopards and numerous other animals as well as over 300 species of bird.
           The activities at Ol Kinyei Adventure Camp consist of wildlife-watching excursions (“game drives") in the Ol Kinyei Conservancy in customised 4x4 safari vehicles taking a maximum of six, meaning everyone gets a window seat

           <h2>Olare Orok Conservancy</h2>
           <img src="http://mmconservancy.com/wildlifeconservancy/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Eland-1024x497.jpg">
           <p>The community conservancy concept is part of a new model of safari-tourism designed to create a mutually beneficial partnership between the Maasai and the tour operators. Instead of buying the land off the Maasai, the land is leased for the purpose of wildlife conservation. This is preferable for the Maasai as they have a guaranteed annual income (the amount paid is per acre not per guest) and they retain ownership of the land. Tourism also generates employment as the camp staff, guides and conservancy rangers are all drawn from the families of the Maasai landowners. In return the Maasai vacate the lands removing all sedentary homesteads or livestock bomas within the conservancy. This allows grass and vegetation to recover from overgrazing.

               Lake Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, near Kendu Bay Town, is famed for its culture and other attractions.

               In Dholuo, “Simbi Nyaima” means the village that sank.

               Geologists say it is a crater lake formed about six centuries ago.

               They also believe that the lake came about as a result of earthquakes accompanied by volcanic eruptions.Some of
               the activities to do at the lake include;water sports,boat riding,view flamingoes and many more.

                      Chyulu Hills are a range of hills that sit on the plains of Eastern Province splitting the plains into two with the Maasai tribe on one side and the Kamba people on the other. The series of extinct volcanoes marry the plains at the foothills offering miles and miles of hiking country for any enthusiastic visitor. The climate is hot and dry most time of the year, and though the hills do not have a permanent water body, rainwater seeps into the rocks and flows to Tsavo River, Mzima Springs and Galana River.The national park is just part of the bounty for your trip because exploring the rest of the hills not included in the park is quite an experience. These hills are extinct volcanoes whose last eruption took place decades ago. Hike to the top and view Mount Kilimanjaro and Amboseli.

                        The upper slopes of this isolated forested massif, surrounded on all sides by the arid badlands characteristic of northern Kenya, are protected in a national park studded with crater lakes. Further afield, the area is scattered with 'singing wells', named for the local Borena custom of singing while several dozen of them form a queue by the steep walls to pass along buckets of water one by one.

                        Miles from any beaten tourist track, Marsabit is serviced by what must be the country's quietest game lodge,
                        with a fine location above a forest-fringed crater lake teeming with birds and visited daily by elephants.

                        Home to hundreds of bird species, it is also an important flyway passage and stopover for migrant birds from northern Asia and Europe.
